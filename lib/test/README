These are the unit tests for the Gliffy Online PHP Client

In order for these tests to work, you need to have a valid config.php file in the '../src' directory.  

Please do not check your own personal config.php into source control.  Instead, create a symlink to your config.php.

All unit tests should output valid JUnit XML output to the ../test-results directory.  
By doing so, our Continuous Integration Server will run the tests after each commit to source control.
